  <h2>My Projects:</h2>
  <ul>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/hello-world/">Hello-World Webpage</a></li>
  <p>This is a basic HTML webpage I worked on while first practicing how to write HTML here at Epicodus. The webpage displays greetings in different languages.</p>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/goodbye/">Goodbye Webpage</a></li>
<p>This is also a basic HTML webpage made by me while practicing HTML here at Epicodus.The webpage shows a text of goodbyes written in several different languages.</p>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/Candles/">Zay's Candle Shop Webpage</a>
<p>This webpage was created by me last year using HTML & CSS. This webpage links to 3 other pages and gives more information about a hypothetical candle shop I own. page links are on the Left side they will not apear visible until you hover over it with a mouse. The homepage link is not functioning well but the other links should take you to a page.</p>
