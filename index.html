  <h2>My Projects:</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/hello-world/">Hello-World Webpage</a></li>
  <p>This is a basic HTML webpage I worked on while first practicing how to write HTML here at Epicodus. The webpage displays greetings in different languages.</p>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/goodbye/">Goodbye Webpage</a></li>
<p>This is also a basic HTML webpage made by me while practicing HTML here at Epicodus.The webpage shows a text of goodbyes written in several different languages.</p>
    <li><a href="https://zejama.github.io/Candles/">Zay's Candle Shop Webpage</a>
<p>This webpage was created by me last year using HTML & CSS. This webpage links to 3 other pages and gives more information about a hypothetical candle shop I own. page links are on the Left side they will not apear visible until you hover over it with a mouse. The homepage link is not functioning well but the other links should take you to a page.</p></li>

<h3>About Me:</h3>

<span>
<p>My name is Zeinab Jama and I am a junior at Portland State University. I'm working towards a Bachelors of Science in Business Technology and Analytics.</p> 
<p>I originally grew interested in the field of software development after a friend had suggested I take a summer Unix/linux class. That summer I made the decision to switch my major from Biology to Comuputer Science.</p>
<p>I enjoyed programming a lot but after a year of CS I realized the PSU CS program was extremely harsh and it was severly affecting my mental health. I switched majors again and this time I chose Business Tech and Analytics.</p> 
<p>I enjoy my major and I've learned enough programming to play around with during my free time. I would love to learn more about programming through this Epicodus program and Eventually get a job position in the tech industry.</p>
